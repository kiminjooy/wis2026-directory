An intuitive model-building framework combined with a digital twin–based pre-validation system enables scenario testing and risk assessment before deployment. In operation, the platform provides stabilization features including monitoring and rollback.\n\nBy integrating equipment, metrology, and historical data, Amfibian performs virtual metrology (VM) and control optimization, delivering not only diagnostics but also concrete adjustment guidance. Designed as an add-on to existing MES and APC environments, it allows rapid deployment and is scalable from CMP to a wide range of semiconductor processes.",

While traditional AI focuses on identifying objects, MACS interprets the meaning behind actions—such as \"a person collapsing\" or \"a motorcycle operating without a helmet.\" This is achieved through sophisticated Vision-Language Model (VLM) technology, which analyzes video and text data simultaneously.\n\nUnlike conventional detection systems, MACS utilizes VLM to enable complex situational awareness even with minimal training data. Furthermore, our lightweight architecture allows for more CCTV channels per GPU, offering superior scalability and cost-efficiency.\n\nMACS features real-time threat detection and instant alerts, enabling immediate response to emergencies. Our technology is certified by major Korean authorities (KISA, KTL), boasting an F1-score of over 96 and a detection accuracy of 90%+ in complex environments.\n\nFrom falls and fires to trespassing and crowd density, MACS provides flexible detection types tailored to your needs. It is the ideal solution for urban surveillance, industrial sites, ports, airports, and luxury resorts.",
