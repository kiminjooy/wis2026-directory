An intuitive model-building framework combined with a digital twin–based pre-validation system enables scenario testing and risk assessment before deployment. In operation, the platform provides stabilization features including monitoring and rollback.\n\nBy integrating equipment, metrology, and historical data, Amfibian performs virtual metrology (VM) and control optimization, delivering not only diagnostics but also concrete adjustment guidance. Designed as an add-on to existing MES and APC environments, it allows rapid deployment and is scalable from CMP to a wide range of semiconductor processes.",

While traditional AI focuses on identifying objects, MACS interprets the meaning behind actions—such as \"a person collapsing\" or \"a motorcycle operating without a helmet.\" This is achieved through sophisticated Vision-Language Model (VLM) technology, which analyzes video and text data simultaneously.\n\nUnlike conventional detection systems, MACS utilizes VLM to enable complex situational awareness even with minimal training data. Furthermore, our lightweight architecture allows for more CCTV channels per GPU, offering superior scalability and cost-efficiency.\n\nMACS features real-time threat detection and instant alerts, enabling immediate response to emergencies. Our technology is certified by major Korean authorities (KISA, KTL), boasting an F1-score of over 96 and a detection accuracy of 90%+ in complex environments.\n\nFrom falls and fires to trespassing and crowd density, MACS provides flexible detection types tailored to your needs. It is the ideal solution for urban surveillance, industrial sites, ports, airports, and luxury resorts.",

This dual-layer architecture reduces persistent connectivity and significantly limits the attack surface across all segregated environments — without requiring multiple terminals or complex network infrastructure.\n\n🔷 PRODUCT BRIEFS \nSecuDongle – Mobile Network Edition\nA compact BNAB-based security device tailored for mobile and personal secure computing.\nEnables hardware-level network isolation without requiring additional infrastructure.\nWell-suited for remote professionals and controlled on-demand internet access.\nIncludes optional control over wireless interfaces such as WiFi and Bluetooth to reduce unintended connectivity paths\n\nSecuDongle – Standard Edition\nA robust hardware-enforced solution engineered for enterprise environments requiring strict network domain separation.\nSupports multi-device and multi-VM mapping within a single PC architecture to meet higher assurance demands.\nDesigned for secure endpoint environments that must operate across distinct security domains without cross-network exposure.\n\n🔷 DIFFERENTIATION \nUnlike conventional software-based isolation, SecuDongle enforces event-driven, hardware-level physical network segregation.\n• Enforces default network disconnection at the device level\n• Activates connections only when explicitly required\n• Automatically revokes network access after task completion\n• Prevents unintended cross-network exposure\n• Supports multi-device and multi-VM mapping on a single PC\n• Enables operation across networks with different security classifications\n• Eliminates always-on connectivity risks\n• Provides deterministic and auditable enforcement\n• Delivers hardware-based assurance beyond firewall or VM-only approaches",
